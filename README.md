# 9b9t's DeathMessages Configuration
So, here's how it works. You want a change, you make a PR. I review it, approve it, and it gets merged, and it gets released whenever.
You may both edit an existing death message or add a new one.

Here are the rules:
- No referencing specific players.
- No links.
- No colors.
- Use YAML properly. That means space-indented, 2-width.

Failing to follow this will result in your PR being rejected.

Have fun!
